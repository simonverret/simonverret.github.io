I am a postdoc at Université de Sherbrooke working with professors André-Marie Tremblay and Louis Taillefer. My research interests mainly revolve around high temperature superconductors. In particular, I study  phenomenological models of the pseudogap and cluster methods for strongly correlated systems.

I rely heavily on visualization with python and mathematica to understand what I do. During my PhD, some brilliant blog posts helped me understand computer tricks, math proofs, and physics concepts. I now have some tricks of my own to show off, and this is why this website/blog exists. Feel free to contact me if you have questions or suggestions, and stay tune form more!
