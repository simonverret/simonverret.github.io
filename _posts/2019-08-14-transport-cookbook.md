I put up this page to share the following document:

[**Transport Theory Cookbook for Cuprates**](https://github.com/simonverret/transport_cookbook/blob/master/cookbook.pdf).

Note that the last pages of this document reproduce my post on the [dispersion of cuprates]({% post_url 2018-10-05-dispersion-of-cuprates %}).

Togheter with [Maxime Charlebois](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=f-jMRJkAAAAJ&hl=en), and later [Gaël Grissonnanche](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=jC912LAAAAAJ&hl=fr), in Sherbrooke, we developped a couple of codes that implement several of the formula given in the above document. These codes could help further work on transport in cuprates. [The first](https://github.com/simonverret/transportBuddy) is for zero temperature only. [The second](https://github.com/gaelgrissonnanche/cuprates_transport) is still being improved (mostly by Gaël) so the documentation is not ready yet, it was used for the computations of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01725).
