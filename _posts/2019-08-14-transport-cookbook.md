I put up this page to share the following document:

[**Transport Theory Cookbook for Cuprates**]({{ site.url }}/files/transport_cookbook_for_cuprates.pdf).

Note that the last pages of this document reproduce my post on the [dispersion of cuprates]({% post_url 2018-10-05-dispersion-of-cuprates %}).

Togheter with [Maxime Charlebois](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=f-jMRJkAAAAJ&hl=en), and later [GaÃ«l Grissonnanche](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=jC912LAAAAAJ&hl=fr), in Sherbrooke, we developped two codes that implement several of the formula given in there. Since these codes could guide further work on transport in cuprates, I want to make them available on github shortly. Stay tuned!
