I put up this page to make available my

[**Transport Theory Cookbook for Cuprates**]({{ site.url }}/files/transport_cookbook_for_cuprates.pdf).

Note that the last pages of this document reproduce my post on the [dispersion of cuprates](post_url 2018-10-05-dispersion-of-cuprates) in part.

Also, with [Maxime Charlebois](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=f-jMRJkAAAAJ&hl=en) and [GaÃ«l Grissonnanche](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=jC912LAAAAAJ&hl=fr) in Sherbrooke, we developped two codes implementing a few of the formula in there. This could guide other work on transport in cuprates, and I want to make them available on github shortly for some student to use them, Stay tuned!
