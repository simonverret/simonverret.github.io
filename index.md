I am a postdoctoral researcher in condensed matter physics at Université de Sherbrooke. I work with professor David Sénéchal, André-Marie Tremblay and Louis Taillefer. My research is mainly about high temperature superconductors, in particular phenomenological models of the pseudogap and cluster methods for strongly correlated systems. During my PhD, brilliant blog posts were precious sources for code snippets, math proofs, and understanding a few physics concepts. Now that I have some tricks of my own to show off, I decided to make this website. Feel free to contact me if you have questions.
