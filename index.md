<p>I am a postdoctoral researcher in condensed matter physics at Université de Sherbrooke. I work with professors David Sénéchal, André-Marie Tremblay and Louis Taillefer. My research is focused on high temperature superconductors, in particular phenomenological models of the pseudogap and cluster methods for strongly correlated systems.</p>
<p>During my PhD, research blogs were precious sources for math proofs, short scripts, and understanding a few physics concepts. Now that I have some tricks of my own to show, I decided to make this website. Feel free to contact me if you have questions.</p>
<p>Note that a french version of this wesite should be available soon. In the meanwhile, you can watch my PhD defense below (in French).</p>

Credits: the introduction is basically exactly 
Matt Might's <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/">"illustrated guide to a Ph.D."</a>, and the history of materials is heavily inspired from the excellent book <a href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/21869/stuff-matters">"Stuff Matters"</a> by Mark Miodownik.
