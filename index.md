I am a postdoctoral researcher in condensed matter physics at Université de Sherbrooke. I work with professors David Sénéchal, André-Marie Tremblay and Louis Taillefer. My research is focused on high temperature superconductors, in particular phenomenological models of the pseudogap and cluster methods for strongly correlated systems. During my PhD, a few brilliant blog posts were precious sources for code snippets, math proofs, and understanding a few physics concepts. Now that I have some tricks of my own to show, I decided to make this website. Feel free to contact me if you have questions.
