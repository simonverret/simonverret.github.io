<p>I am currently postdoctoral researcher at the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithm (MILA) under Professor Yoshua Bengio. I work in partnership with the Institut Quantique (IQ) in Sherbrooke, to apply deep learning in the research on quantum materials. I work with Professors David Sénéchal, André-Marie Tremblay and Louis Taillefer in Sherbrooke.</p>
<p>During my PhD on high temperature superconductors, research blogs were precious sources for math proofs, short scripts, and explanations on various physical concepts. Now that I have some tricks of my own to show, I decided to make this website. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the content of this website.</p>
<p>I plan to make a French version of this website someday. In the meanwhile, you can watch my PhD defense below (in French).</p>

Credits: the introduction is basically exactly 
Matt Might's <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/">"illustrated guide to a Ph.D."</a>, and the history of materials is heavily inspired from the excellent book <a href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/21869/stuff-matters">"Stuff Matters"</a> by Mark Miodownik.
